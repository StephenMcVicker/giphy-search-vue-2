## About

This project was built as a bit of fun and practice with the Vue 2 framework.
My goal with this project was to reach out to a 3rd party API, using a private API key stored in an .env file, grab some data and display it (nicely).
Giphy, a gif site, is the perfect way to visualize fetching data.

Little touches were added such as the custom-styled scroll bars and the ability to copy the embed link for each gif.

Gif display is limited to 12 results and is mobile friendly.
